      <li>Select tool can be used to select individual objects by clicking them</li>
      <li>When a single shape is selected, the circle to it's top can be dragged to rotate the circle around the center. Double-clicking the circle will reset it's rotation.</li>
      <li>Multi Select is done by using the select tool to drag (start from whitespace) and surrounding the objects to select within the semitransparent blue box</li>
      <li>the Select+ tool is similar to the normal select tool, but selecting shapes doesn't unselect the previously selected shapes</li>
      <li>The Rectangle and Image tools work the same way, mouse down to define where to start and lift the mouse button to define where it ends</li>
      <li>The ellipse tool is similar to the rectangle tool, but the mouse down defines the center and the lift position defines the radii</li>
      <li>The line tool is similar to the rectangle tool, the initial mousedown defines where it starts and the mouseup defines where it ends</li>
      <li>The path tool is like the line tool but it tracks all movements of the mouse in between</li>
      <li>The polygon tool is the least intutive tool. Click (not mousedown) on where to start, and click in various locations to define verticies and double click at the last point to end.</li>
      <li>The text tool is similar to the ellipse tool, mouse down to define the center and the horizontal drag distance defines the font size</li>
      <li>Basic deleting is just selecting whatever shapes using the Select or Select+ tools and clicking the delete button.</li>
      <li>Deleting can also be done after selecting the tool by clicking shapes to delete or by dragging from the whitespace over the ones to delete (similar to the select tool)</li>
      <li>The markup button shows the raw SVG or VML markup generated by Raphael</li>
    </ul>
